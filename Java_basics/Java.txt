Understanding the difference between Comparable and Comparator is crucial for sorting objects in Java. Let me break it down with clear examples and practical DSA applications.

Core Differences at a Glance
Feature	Comparable	Comparator
Package	java.lang	java.util
Method	compareTo()	compare()
Sorting Logic	Natural ordering	Custom ordering
Implementation	Inside the class	Separate class/lambda
Number of Sequences	Single sorting sequence	Multiple sorting sequences
Modifies Class	Yes	No

Key Technical Differences
Method Signature:

Comparable: public int compareTo(T o)

Comparator: public int compare(T o1, T o2)

Prefer ArrayDeque for better performance in single-threaded apps for Stack Implementation
